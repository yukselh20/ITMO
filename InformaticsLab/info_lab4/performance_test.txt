This script will:

Run each implementation 100 times
Measure the average execution time
Compare relative performance between implementations
Display results in a formatted table
Analysis of the implementations:

Task 0 (Manual Parser):

Pure Python implementation
No regex or external libraries
Character-by-character parsing
Simple but potentially slower for complex operations
Task 1 (Built-in Libraries):

Uses Python's native json module
Uses PyYAML for YAML conversion
Highly optimized C implementation
Expected to be the fastest
Task 2 (Regex Parser):

Uses regular expressions for pattern matching
More sophisticated string parsing
Potentially faster than manual parsing for complex patterns
May have regex compilation overhead
Task 3 (Grammar Parser):

Uses Lark parser with formal grammar
Most sophisticated implementation
Has parser generation overhead
Better for complex parsing scenarios
Expected performance order (fastest to slowest):

Task 1 (Built-in) - Native implementation
Task 2 (Regex) - Optimized string parsing
Task 0 (Manual) - Simple but unoptimized
Task 3 (Grammar) - Overhead from parser generation
The actual results will be displayed after running the script, 
showing precise timing differences between implementations
