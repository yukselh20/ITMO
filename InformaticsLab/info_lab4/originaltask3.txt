originaltask3.py (Grammar Parser)
Most sophisticated implementation using formal grammar with Lark parser
Components:
JSON_GRAMMAR: Formal EBNF grammar definition for JSON
JsonTransformer: Converts parse tree into Python data structures
Advanced error handling and proper parsing of nested structures
Uses Lark library for parsing based on formal grammar rules
Most maintainable and theoretically sound approach
